/**
 * @summary Dialogs can require an action, communicate information, or help
 * users accomplish a task. There are two types of dialogs: basic and
 * full-screen.
 *
 * @description
 * A dialog is a modal window that appears in front of app content to provide
 * critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app
 * functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed,
 * dismissed, or a required action has been taken.
 *
 * Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.
 * A less disruptive alternative is to use a menu, which provides options
 * without interrupting a userâ€™s experience.
 *
 * On mobile devices only, complex dialogs should be displayed fullscreen.
 *
 * __Example usages:__
 * - Common use cases for basic dialogs include alerts, quick selection, and
 * confirmation.
 * - More complex dialogs may contain actions that require a series of tasks
 * to complete. One example is creating a calendar entry with the event title,
 * date, location, and time.
